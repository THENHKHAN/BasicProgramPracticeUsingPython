# Python Program to Print All Prime Numbers in an Interval (user defined)









# The user has to give the upper limit and the lower limit of the interval as input and our program should display all the Prime Numbers within that interval. 

# INFO :
'''
A Prime Number is a natural number that is greater than 1 and has only two factors, 1 and the number itself. 
First, few prime numbers are- 2,3,5,7,11.. and so on. Numbers that are not prime are called composite numbers 
and have more than 2 factors.

'''
#APPROACH
'''
For executing this task our approach will be to run a loop from the lower limit to the upper limit and check each number 
in this interval if it is prime or not. 
'''

# I/O
'''
The program should take input as follows,

Input- Enter upper limit: 3

Enter lower limit: 10

Output- Prime numbers between 3 and 10 are:

3 5 7
